# Python OOP Blackjack Simulation

Welcome to my Python OOP Blackjack Simulation repository! This project is a simple yet illustrative demonstration of my programming and code organization skills.

## Introduction

Blackjack is one of the most popular card games in the world, known for its blend of chance, strategy, and skill. I chose to simulate this game using Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to showcase my ability to model real-world scenarios and my understanding of OOP principles.

## Why This Project?

The purpose of publishing this exercise is to provide a tangible example of my approach to problem-solving and project structuring. While the application itself is straightforward, it incorporates a range of programming fundamentals that are critical in a developer's toolkit.

## Features

- **OOP Design**: The game is built using classes and objects, mirroring real-life components of a Blackjack game such as the deck, the dealer, and the player.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Run the script, and play against the computer in a simulated Blackjack environment.
- **Strategic AI**: The dealer, controlled by the computer, follows traditional Blackjack strategies to make decisions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The game is played in the console, with clear prompts and easy-to-understand messages.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Class-Based Structure**: Exhibiting how to effectively use classes and methods in Python.
- **Modular Code**: Organized for readability, maintainability, and scalability.
- **Exception Handling**: Ensuring the program runs smoothly and handles unexpected inputs gracefully.
- **Python Best Practices**: Adhering to PEP 8 standards and Pythonic principles for clean code.

## How to Run

To play the Blackjack simulation, simply clone this repository, navigate to the directory in your terminal, and run the following command:

```bash
python blackjack.py
